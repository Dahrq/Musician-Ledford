    <h2>History</h2>

        <p>NF was born Nathan Feuerstein on March 30, 1991, in Gladwin, Michigan.  During his childhood, his parents were
        divorced, and he was originally to live with his mother, but later his father had to take Nate away to live with him
        after his mother's boyfriend would abuse him and his siblings.  His mother died from an overdose in 2009 after years
        of substance abuse, leading him to dedicate one of his songs to her, "How Could You Leave Us"(Therapy Session.  NF
        started his career at the Fine Arts Festival organized by Connection Church in Canton, Michigan. <br>

            NF stated that, during his childhood, rap was an escape for him. He would record songs on a karaoke
            machine, recording instrumentals on one microphone and his raps on the other. On November 29, 2010,
            NF independently released his debut studio album Moments under his real name. On August 2, 2011, he
            released his debut single "Alone". The song featured songwriter and producer Tommee Profitt and Brooke
            Griffith. In 2012, NF's work attracted the attention of Xist Music. On May 2, 2012, he released his
            debut extended play I'm Free with production work from Profitt. The tracklist consisted of nine songs
            including "Alone". The EP also included an exclusive version of "Alone" featuring Sean Simmonds. Xist
            teased for the release of the self-titled extended play, NF, but NF parted ways with the label after
            a dispute and the production of NF was postponed. Despite this, NF featured a song, "Only One",
            featuring Shuree Williams, in the label's compilation album, Move Vol 1. He released a single,
            "Beautiful Addiction", on November 4, 2013. The song again featured an appearance from Profitt, as well as
            vocals from Brady Schmitz and Danielle Swift. NF signed to Capitol Christian Music Group in 2014,
            before the release of the EP, NF. This project was his breakthrough release on the Billboard, as it
            charted on the Christian Albums chart at No. 12, on the Top Gospel Albums at No. 4, and on the Top Rap
            Albums at No. 15. This extended play was reviewed by Jesus Freak Hideout and New Release Tuesday,
            receiving two three-and-a-half-star reviews. CCM Magazine reviewed the EP and awarded it four stars.
            His first studio album, Mansion, was released on March 31, 2015 by Capitol CMG. From there, he wold release
            <i>Therapy Session</i>, <i>Perception</i>, and <i>The Search</i></p>
